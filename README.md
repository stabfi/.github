Many useful services for securely managing your crypto startup finances are in open-source project Stabfi — completely free.

# Features:
- Minting
> In a few simple steps, you can create your own ERC20 token for the project (it is possible to add Minting / Burning capabilities to the counter) from a completely secure OpenZeppelin smart contract.
- Locking
> Freeze any tokens (ERC20) for a certain period with the possibility of extending the blocking. (Use case: For example, locking liquidity tokens for projects after launch). Blocking is done on your own smart contract, open source without proxy.
- Airdrop
> Send any of your ERC20 tokens to multiple recipients at once. Completely secure solutions are used in different networks.
- Vesting
> Create vesting schedules in a convenient constructor with any number of rounds and unlock conditions of any complexity. Generate CSV files to pay out tokens to all recipients in one transaction quickly.
- Claimy app
> Turn your vesting into a participant's office, design it in the style of your project and forget about payments to participants in the vesting. Now they will be able to monitor their own vesting schedule and withdraw available funds through Claimy! Funds are locked in your own Claimy smart contract, open source, and without proxy.
